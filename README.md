# Leptos Axum JS SSR Example

This example shows the various ways that JavaScript may be included into
a Leptos application.  The intent is to demonstrate how this may be done
and how it may cause the application to fail in an unexpected manner if
done incorrectly.

## Quick Start

Run `cargo leptos watch` to run this example.
